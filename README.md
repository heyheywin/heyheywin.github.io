# Winfield Fan's personal site

Welcome to my personal portfolio site. Built on Gatsby, a JAMstack optimised version of ReactJS.
JAMstack stands for Javascript, API, and Markdown, coined by Netlify CEO [Mathias Biilman](https://twitter.com/biilmann). Gatsby is largely similar to React, but preferred due to a significant base of built-in plugins and Markdown friendly frameworks that will be utilise in the future for blogging. JAMstack is the future of web development, with large benefits in time to market due to friendly interfacing with cloud hosting services like AWS and etc.
The project is hosted on Netlify.
Feel free to explore and you can find my contact details within.
